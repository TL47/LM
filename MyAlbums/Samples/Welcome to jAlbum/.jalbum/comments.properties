Chapter03.htt=<p>Besides <b>images</b>, <b>videos</b> and <b>folders</b> you can add many things to a jAlbum album. For example, this text was added as a <b>Custom page</b> <code>New page → Empty page</code>. By default jAlbum creates separate HTML pages of these custom pages, but in modern skins, you can also embed them into the index page (supported by Story skin, Photoblogger 3+ and Tiger 3+).</p>\
<p>If you’d like to add <b>text formatting</b> on these pages (or chapters), use jAlbum’s <b>built-in HTML editor</b>! (Available since v21)</p>\
<p><img src="${resPath}/RichTextEditor.png"></p>\
<p>To <b>add an image</b> – like this one above –, first drop it onto the album's top level "res" folder. (Create one if there’s no such.) Then you can refer to this picture from any place in the album as <code>$&lcub;resPath&rcub;/imageName.png</code>.</p>\
<p>You can also add <b>external pages</b>, like the one below with <code>New page → Web location</code>:</p>
jAlbum-banner.jpg=This image is used only for the "hero" area – a.k.a "theme image" –, therefore it is excluded (right-click → exclude). You can select any image by dropping onto the right panel’s "Theme image" area. (In skins that support theme images.)
Dor.png=Not James, just Dor. I am jAlbum’s mascot.

Chapter02.htt=<p>In jAlbum, you can organize your images in any hierarchy. Quite a few users have tens of thousands of images in a single album, organized into deep folder structures. However, it's best keeping the number of the images in a single folder below cca. 500–600, in order to avoid slowdowns on the visitor's browsers.</p>\
<h5>Do you like pets? Here are two folders full of them.</h5>

Chapter01.htt=<p>jAlbum creates sophisticated web photo albums – or even complete web pages – from your images. Just drop a few images onto the application, press <code>Make&nbsp;album</code> and your album is ready to view <code>F12</code>. Finally, it takes just one more step – <code>Upload</code> – to publish it to the internet.</p>
